        <h4 class="project_title">Neural Bots - Unity Game</h4>
        <img class="project_image" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMjEzNzM1LzIyNzkzODQuZ2lm/794x1000/%2FlHlW1.gif" />
        <p>
          In 2017, my friend and I participated in a game jam hosted by the well-known game development community YouTuber TairaGames. We
          had
          7 days to create a game from scratch that would fit the theme "Rage Game," inspired by "Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy."
        </p>
        <p>
          We won the game jam and received a shoutout from TairaGames himself. The game was published on itch.io and received many
          downloads, but the
          story didn't end there. A couple of days later, the game was featured on <a
            href="https://youtu.be/29MN05GWgAo?list=PLp5b4Z3BZVww3i5BNswy-hadzduTTrXaN&t=1410">Markiplier's channel</a> and received even
          more downloads. This was
          crazy for us; we were just two young developers from Georgia, and our game was played by one of the biggest YouTubers in the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This small success inspired me to continue working on the game. I added more mechanics, levels, and even a level editor and
          authentication system. However, I had to stop working on the game because of my studies and other projects.
        </p>
        <p>I still hope to revisit the project sometime in the future, but with a lower scope to make it more manageable.</p>
        <p class="note">Unfortunately, the only build that exists of the game is the original game jam build.</p>

          I created this game in 2020. It is a chess game with a unique twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chess Destroyer is similar to a traditional chess game but with additional features: the map expands with each turn, more enemies
          appear, you can capture an enemy unit by defeating it with your pawn, or acquire new units by completing simple quests that appear
          in the bottom left corner of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defeat enemy units, find allies, protect the king, and survive as long as you can!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lore: To escape from death, the king had to flee the battleground. With his two pawns, he jumped from his chessboard onto another,
          smaller one. But it's growing, and enemies are coming.

        <p>
          I have worked on many other games, but most of them are small prototypes or unfinished projects. I have also worked on some games
          for clients, but I can't share them here because of NDA agreements.

        <h4 class="project_title">Mody - React Native App (iOS & Android)</h4>
        <img class="project_image"

        <p>
          At some point, I picked up React Native and started working with clients to create mobile apps. One of the apps I worked on is
          Mody, a taxi app for Georgia.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked on both the front-end and back-end of the app. I used Firebase for the back-end and Node.js for the server. The app also
          has a payment system integrated with TBC Bank's API.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the app didn't gain much traction, but I learned a lot from the experience.
        </p>
        <p class="note">I also worked on several other apps, but this was the most interesting one.</p>
