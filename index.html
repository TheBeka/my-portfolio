        This is my passion and the thing I spend the most time working on. I
        started when I was 14 (2014) and throughout the years made more than 30
        small games. mostly for game jams or Android. you can check them out on
        <a href="https://the-red-ghost-studio.itch.io/">itch.io</a> and

        <b style="margin-left: 40px">Programming</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Programming is a skill I managed to learn by teaching myself to develop
        games. I started with C# (the programming language used in unity) and
        later in university learned the basics of many more languages(Python,
        Java, PHP, Javascript, SQL, Kotlin and Dart). I will link some of my
        projects below. Even though programming wasn't something I wanted to
        learn in the beginning, I still find it very interesting now. As you may
        know C# os OOP language so I know how to use classes, inheritance,
        Interfaces, and more. Also in game development, I pretty much had to
        learn some patterns too. So to conclude, I'd say I am a pretty much good
        programmer and every day try to become better
      </p>

      <h3 style="position: relative">Web Development(backend with PHP)</h3>
      <p>
        For Neural bots, I decided to let players make their own
        content(levels), and for that, I needed to learn databases and some
        backend language. even though I could have gone for C# and ASP.net
        instead I learned PHP and later in university Laravel(PHP framework).
